# 中文Level

Trying to figure out, if I had to separate Chinese into 6x10 = 60 levels, just like https://www.wanikani.com, how would I do it?

My current answer is, follow the textbooks and HSK, and sometimes, [wordfreq](https://github.com/LuminosoInsight/wordfreq) and [junda](http://lingua.mtsu.edu/chinese-computing/statistics/char/list.php?Which=TO) (but secondarily).

See my current answer [here](/current).
